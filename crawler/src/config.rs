/// - Command-line arguments
/// - A TOML configuration file that can be loaded and parsed into the `Config` struct.

    /// command-line arguments alone.

    /// - `file_path`: A string slice that specifies the path to the configuration file.
    ///
    /// ### Returns:
    /// - `Ok(Config)` on success, containing the deserialized configuration.
    /// - `Err(Box<dyn Error>)` if an error occurs during file reading or TOML parsing.

    /// ### Steps:
    /// 1. The function opens the specified file. If the file cannot be opened, an error is returned.
    /// 2. The contents of the file are read into a string.
    /// 3. The string is then parsed from TOML format into the `Config` struct using Serde's TOML deserialization.
