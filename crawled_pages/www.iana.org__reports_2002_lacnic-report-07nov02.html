      <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (the IANA), as part of the administrative 
        functions associated with management of the Internet Protocol (IP) address 
        space, is responsible for evaluating applications for approval of new 
        Regional Internet Registries. ICANN has received an application for final 
        approval and recognition of the Regional Latin-American and Caribbean 
        IP Address Registry (LACNIC) as the fourth Regional Internet Registry.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Background"></a>Background</b></p>
      <p>The role and responsibilities of ICANN/IANA in this area are defined 
        in the <a href="http://www.icann.org/aso/aso-mou-26aug99.htm">Address 
        Supporting Organization Memorandum of Understanding</a> (ASO MOU) , and 
        <a href="http://www.icann.org/icp/icp-2.htm">ICP-2</a> (&quot;Criteria 
        for Establishment of New Regional Internet Registries&quot;).</p>
      <p>The ASO MoU <a href="http://www.icann.org/aso/aso-mou-26aug99.htm#1c">provides</a> 
        that &quot;[a]dditional RIRs may join in signing the MOU after they have 
        been approved by ICANN.&quot; The ASO MOU specifies that, in carrying 
        out this responsibility, &quot;ICANN will develop requirements and policies 
        for the approval of additional RIRs.&quot; <a href="http://www.icann.org/aso/aso-mou-26aug99.htm#9">Section 
        9 of the ASO MOU</a> articulates seven basic requirements for new and 
        existing RIRs.</p>
      <p>In April 2001, after an open policy-development process and extensive 
        public consultation, the <a href="http://www.icann.org/aso/emerging-rir-transmittal-24apr01.htm">Address 
        Council submitted</a> to the ICANN Board the &quot;Criteria for Establishment 
        of New Regional Internet Registries,&quot; as a more specific, minimum 
        statement of guidelines and essential preconditions for the evaluation 
        and approval of new RIRs. At the same time, the Address Council recommended 
        that the Board authorize the ICANN staff to receive and evaluate applications 
        for the recognition of new RIRs, using the criteria as a statement of 
        minimum requirements.</p>
      <p>In June 2001, the Board <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-04jun01.htm#EmergingRegionalInternetRegistries">accepted 
        the criteria document</a> as a statement of essential requirements, supplementing 
        Section 9 of the ASO-MOU, and acknowledged it as a framework for consideration 
        of applications for recognition of new RIRs. At the same time, the Board 
        authorized the President &quot;to establish procedures and standards for 
        the receipt of applications for recognition of new RIRs and for the evaluation 
        of those applications, according to section 9 of the ASO-MOU and consistent 
        with the requirements set forth in the Criteria&quot; and &quot;to devote 
        sufficient resources&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the timely evaluation of 
        any applications according to those procedures and standards.&quot; The 
        ICANN President, with the assistance of the IANA, established procedures 
        and standards for receipt and evaluation of new RIR applications.</p>
      <p>On 28 November 2001, an <a href="http://www.icann.org/aso/lacnic-application-28nov01.pdf">application</a> 
        was submitted by the LACNIC organization for recognition, together with 
        a detailed transition plan, including draft bylaws, policies, funding 
        model, and staff resumes. On request of the ICANN President, the IANA 
        staff conducted a preliminary evaluation; in March 2002 the President 
        reported to the Board his conclusion that the application and transition 
        plan constituted a reasonable basis for eventual recognition, though he 
        noted that some adjustments would be necessary. Also in March 2002, the 
        three existing RIRs (APNIC, ARIN, and the RIPE NCC) communicated a joint 
        statement praising the excellent work of the LACNIC organization, noting 
        the close cooperation between ARIN and LACNIC, and recommending a favorable 
        response to the application by recognizing LACNIC's accomplishments thus 
        far and according an interim status to LACNIC.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the IANA's preliminary evaluation and the recommendations 
        of the existing RIRs, the ICANN Board on 14 March 2002 <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-14mar02.htm#LACNICApplicationandTransitionPlan">gave 
        provisional approval</a> to the LACNIC application, with the expectation 
        that the transition plan would be completed and a final application for 
        recognition would be submitted. Over the following months, the IANA staff 
        continued to consult with LACNIC and ARIN to monitor the transition of 
        information and registration responsibilities, and to assist in finalizing 
        the application for full recognition of LACNIC in conformance with the 
        criteria set forth in the ASO MoU and ICP-2.</p>
      <p>Since March, the LACNIC organization has supplemented and finalized its 
        application, which has been carefully reviewed and evaluated by the IANA, 
        according to the guidance and principles stated in the ASO MoU and ICP-2. 
        On 30 October 2002, the President of ARIN communicated ARIN's favorable 
        assessment of LACNIC's readiness for final approval and recognition.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</b></p>
      <p>In evaluating the LACNIC application for final approval and recognition, 
        the IANA follows the guidelines and principles documented in the ASO MoU 
        and ICP-2. Each of the ten ICP-2 principles is set forth <i>in italics</i> 
        below, followed by the IANA's evaluation and analysis. Helpfully, the 
        LACNIC application document tracks the numbered principles set forth in 
        ICP-2.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation1"></a>1) The region of coverage should meet the 
        scale to be defined by ICANN, given the need to avoid global address fragmentation.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 1. LACNIC will operate internationally, 
        across a large geographic region of greater-than-continental size (see 
        ICP-2: &quot;The proposed RIR must operate internationally in a large 
        geographical region of approximately continental size.&quot;; see also 
        RFC 2050, page 3). Specifically, LACNIC's service region will cover the 
        following countries and territories:</p>

      <p>Based on consultation among the IANA, LACNIC, and ARIN, the above list 
        omits two territories (Bouvet Island and St. Helena) that were mentioned 
        in the November 2001 LACNIC application, in view of their distance from 
        the South American continent.</p>
      <p>LACNIC operates under a unified management, with a single location for 
        registration operations. LACNIC's operations are in S&atilde;o Paulo, 
        while its administrative headquarters are in Montevideo. Both the internal 
        administrative and membership structures of LACNIC are designed, consistent 
        with the existing RIR models, to avoid address space fragmentation, difficulties 
        with inter-RIR coordination and cooperation, and community confusion.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation2"></a>2) The new RIR must demonstrate that it 
        has the broad support of the LIRs (ISP community) in the proposed region.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 2. LACNIC has conducted extensive 
        regional outreach and encouraged community input and involvement through 
        its Open Policy Forum. A joint ARIN/LACNIC communication was sent to all 
        ARIN members in the proposed LACNIC service region, and LACNIC has made 
        independent efforts to contact and communicate with ISPs across Latin 
        America and the Caribbean, including use of public mailing lists, its 
        website, presentations at conferences and meetings, and direct contacts 
        with individual local Internet registries (LIRs) and ISPs.</p>
      <p>The IANA's review of the LACNIC efforts and the response of the relevant 
        community within the region supports the conclusion that a very substantial 
        majority are prepared to support LACNIC as the new regional RIR, to participate 
        actively in its bottom-up policy-development processes, and to make the 
        necessary financial commitment to support LACNIC's operations.</p>
      <p>In addition, over the period of the transition LACNIC has demonstrated 
        full capability to migrate existing ARIN service agreements to LACNIC.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation3"></a>3) Bottom-up self-governance structure for 
        setting local policies.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 3. LACNIC has developed and 
        implemented clearly defined procedures for the development of resource-management 
        policies for its service region, as well as for participating in development 
        of global policy recommendations through the Address Supporting Organization.</p>
      <p>Drawing from the experiences and models of the ARIN, APNIC, and RIPE 
        NCC bottom-up policy-development mechanisms, the LACNIC procedures are 
        open and transparent, accessible to all interested parties, and capable 
        of ensuring fair representations of all constituencies within the region. 
        LACNIC has made a documented commitment to at least one open policy development 
        meeting per year, accessible to all interested parties. LACNIC maintains 
        a publicly archived mailing list for the discussion of policies. Members 
        of the LACNIC community participate in working groups on particular policy-development 
        topics.</p>
      <p>Finally, LACNIC has made a commitment to host general assembly meetings 
        of the ASO, as required in the ASO MOU.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation4"></a>4) Neutrality and impartiality in relation 
        to all interested parties, and particularly the LIRs.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 4. LACNIC is an independent, 
        not-for-profit, and open membership association. The submitted LACNIC 
        bylaws and policies provide for equal treatment, fair distribution of 
        resources, and impartial treatment of members and requestors. As reaffirmed 
        in LACNIC's application:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>All customers of LACNIC will be treated equally. The LACNIC policies 
          and guidelines ensure neutral and impartial distribution of resources 
          and non/discriminatory treatment of all members and all requestors. 
          LACNIC is incorporated as an independent, not-for-profit and open bottom-up 
          membership organization, as defined in our bylaws.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As confirmed by ARIN, LACNIC's activities during the transition period 
        have demonstrated full compliance with these principles.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation5"></a>5) Technical expertise.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 5. LACNIC has demonstrated 
        fully competent technical capabilities in all necessary areas, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> production grade global Internet connectivity;</li>
        <li>DNS servers to support Reverse DNS delegation;</li>
        <li>suitable internal infrastructure for operational purposes; and</li>
        <li>enough technically capable staff to ensure appropriate service levels 
          to the its members, and to the Internet community.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>LACNIC has operated with reliable, high-quality connectivity and the 
        capability to operate reliable nameservers. It has also demonstrated the 
        ability to administer the necessary invoicing and accounting systems and 
        other elements of internal infrastructure. The IANA is pleased to note 
        its conclusion that LACNIC's technical operation is impressive, well-designed, 
        well-executed, and staffed by highly competent technical and operational 
        personnel.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation6"></a>6) Adherence to global policies regarding 
        address space conservation, aggregation and registration.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 6. Throughout the transition, 
        <a href="https://mail.lacnic.net/pipermail/politicas/2002-September/000022.html ">LACNIC
        has operated under the ARIN policies</a> that have historically been applicable 
        to allocations and assignments to operators within its service region. 
        Those policies are consistent with the global policies applicable to IP 
        address allocation and assignment.</p>
      <p>LACNIC has made substantial progress toward defining its own regional 
        policies, and at its <a href="http://lacnic.net/sp/eventos/lacniciii/">third
        annual meeting</a> will consider adoption of policies that reflect ARIN's 
        experience, as adapted to LACNIC's service region. LACNIC's policies are 
        fully documented and publicly accessible on its website. These policies, 
        and any changes to them, will be adopted according to LACNIC's open, bottom-up, 
        member-driven policy development process. The provisions of the currently 
        proposed policies appear to be consistent with and to respect the main 
        goals of the IP address registry system (e.g., uniqueness, proper registration, 
        aggregation, conservation, and fairness), demonstrating LACNIC's commitment 
        to adhere to the IP addressing requirements of the global Internet, including 
        global policies concerning conservation, aggregation, and registration.</p>
      <p>LACNIC's longstanding active participation, as an emerging RIR, in the 
        Address Supporting Organization, further demonstrates its commitment to 
        adhere to applicable global policies.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation7"></a>7) Activity plan.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 7. LACNIC has submitted (and 
        published) a detailed activity plan specifying activities that are clearly 
        within the purview of an RIR. The LACNIC activity plan was developed through 
        its open, community-based process, and appears to be accepted and supported 
        by its prospective regional membership.</p>
      <p>LACNIC's activity plan is not limited exclusively to IP address registration 
        services. Its objectives also include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supporting the growth of the Internet in Latin America and the Caribbean.</li>
        <li>Supporting the Latin American and Caribbean community in the development 
          of procedures, mechanisms, and standards in order to assure the efficient 
          assignment of Internet resources.</li>
        <li>Promoting educational opportunities to its members in its technical 
          and political areas of competence.</li>
        <li>Proposing and developing public policies in its areas of competence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>LACNIC also submitted a comprehensive, three-phase transition plan, which 
        was endorsed by the ICANN Board when it gave <a href="http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-14mar02.htm#LACNICApplicationandTransitionPlan">provisional 
        recognition in March 2002</a>. That transition plan has been successfully 
        implemented and has now reached its final stages. The transition plan 
        covered off- and on-site training of LACNIC registration personnel, technical 
        exchanges between ARIN and LACNIC engineering staffs, and full collaboration 
        between LACNIC and ARIN on legal, financial, administrative, and registration 
        matters. </p>
      <p>ARIN has reported favorably on LACNIC's execution of its transition plan, 
        noting, for example, that at no time over the course of the transition 
        did ARIN's second opinions on allocations and assignments differ with 
        LACNIC's determinations.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the guidance of ICP-2, LACNIC has committed not to be 
        involved in forward domain-name assignment or administration.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation8"></a>8) Funding model.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 8. LACNIC is established as 
        a not-for-profit association. Consistent with its activity plan, the LACNIC 
        budget has been drawn up and published with support from the community 
        of its prospective membership. Though initial funding is being provided 
        by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (Comit&ecirc; Gestor da Internet 
        no Brasil.), LACNIC has adopted a fee structure that will enable it to 
        be financially independent and supported entirely by its membership.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation9"></a>9) Record Keeping.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 9. LACNIC has established 
        capabilities to maintain proper records of all registry activities, including 
        the archiving of all information collected from local Internet registries 
        in the process of making IP address space assignments. As specified in 
        ICP-2, the official registration language for LACNIC will be English, 
        including the relevant core registry documentation, records, archives, 
        and information needed for operational audits.</p>
      <p><i><a name="Evaluation10"></a>10) Confidentiality.</i></p>
      <p>The LACNIC application satisfies Principle 10. LACNIC has developed and 
        implemented a comprehensive set of policies and procedures to ensure that 
        the information its collects in the registration process will be kept 
        in strict confidence, and used for registration purposes only. As stated 
        in LACNIC's application:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>All information that LACNIC receives from customers will be kept under 
          strict norms of confidentiality and used for registration purpose only. 
          In case of information is requested about a customer by another RIR 
          or IANA, LACNIC will transmit this information under the same confidentiality 
          agreement, but will not be transmitted to any other party unless explicitly 
          agreed to in writing by the RIR/ISP served.</p>
        <p>LACNIC establishes herein that Board Members are not allowed to participate 
          in discussions where there are conflicts of interest. All board members 
          and staff members are required to sign non-disclosure statements (see 
          ANNEX VI LACNIC Non disclosure agreements).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In addition, LACNIC has provided a copy of its model non-disclosure agreement.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p>In sum, LACNIC has met all of the conditions specified in the ASO MOU 
        and ICP-2. LACNIC's operations, policies, and bottom-up self-governance 
        structure comply fully with the specified guidelines. LACNIC's technical 
        operations and expertise are impressive. The transition plan has been 
        satisfactorily executed. LACNIC's cooperation with ARIN has been exemplary, 
        and ARIN has given its full endorsement to approval and recognition of 
        LACNIC as an independent RIR.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, the IANA concludes that LACNIC has met all the necessary 
        requirements for approval and recognition.</p>
