<h1>Procedures for the IDN Repository</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Repository of IDN Practices was created to support the development
of the internationalized domain names (IDNs) by promoting the sharing
of registry IDN policies. The policies are referred to as “Label
Generation Rulesets” (LGRs), and historically as “IDN tables” or “variant tables.”</p>
<p>Specifically, as described in the <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/topics/idn/idn-guidelines-02sep11-en.htm">Guidelines for the Implementation
of Internationalized Domain Names</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A registry will publish one or several lists of Unicode code points
that are permitted for registration and will not accept the
registration of any name containing an unlisted code point. Each such
list will indicate the script or language(s) it is intended to support.
If registry policy treats any code point in a list as a variant of any
other code point, the nature of that variance and the policies attached
to it will be clearly articulated. All such code point listings will be
placed in the IANA Repository for IDN TLD Practices in tabular format
together with any rules applied to the registration of names containing
those code points, before any such registration may be accepted.
</blockquote>

<p>We do not maintain the content of the data and hence are not responsible for
its accuracy. The sole purpose of the repository is to publish LGRs that have
been verified as coming from representatives of domain registries. Registries
that implement IDN support are strongly encouraged to use this repository,
and some may be contractually required to do so by ICANN.</p>
<h2>LGR Requirements</h2>
<p>LGRs should be listed in one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Label Generation Ruleset format (recommended). See 
  <a href="/go/rfc7940">RFC 7940</a>.</li>
<li>ASCII or UTF-8 encoded text file, adhering to common conventions
  such as those documented in <a href="/go/rfc3743">RFC 3743</a> and <a href="/go/rfc4290">RFC 4290</a>.
  The format should be applied consistently throughout the document and allow
  for machine parsing.</li>
</ul>
<p>An LGR must contain the following elements in its header:</p>
<ul>
<li>Script or Language Designator (see below for guidance)</li>
<li>Version Number (this must increase with each amendment to the LGR, even if the updates are limited to the header itself)</li>
<li>Effective Date (the date at which the policy becomes applicable in operational use)</li>
<li>Registry Contact Details (contact name, email address, and/or phone number)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that the main purpose of this repository is to encourage re-use and
analysis. As such, we recommend against submitting data in other formats unless
it is not possible to represent the LGR using these available standards.</p>
<h2>Registration Process</h2>
<p>All delegated TLD registries can apply to register an LGR or submit an update to an existing LGR. Deprecated LGRs will be archived and marked as historical. </p>
<h3>gTLD Submissions</h3>
<p>Service requests should be submitted to ICANN via the appropriate Naming Services portal. For more information, see <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/idn-service-requests-en">IDN service requests</a>.</p>
<h3>ccTLD and Other Submissions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anyone may submit a request to list or update an LGR, but we will ask for its
  posting to be approved by the current Administrative Contact for the domain in
  the Root Zone Database. Before submitting any registration or change request, the
  submitter should ensure that the Administrative Contact is aware of the proposed
  LGR and ready to consent to its publication.</li>
<li>A registration request must include all of the necessary elements described in
  the requirements listed above. Requests should be sent to the email address
  idn-tables@iana.org. The submitter will receive a confirmation email containing
  a ticket number.</li>
<li>Requests comprising multiple LGRs should be sent in the form of an archive
  (such as a ZIP or TAR file). For particularly complex applications, involving
  many LGRs or domains, please contact us in advance in order to identify the most
  optimal method of submission that does not involve unnecessary repetition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon submission, within five days either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Administrative Contact will receive an email, with the Technical Contact and submitter in copy, requesting the Administrative Contact’s confirmation that the details of the request are correct, or </li>
<li>the submitter will receive notice that the LGR does not contain all of the elements necessary for registration. The LGR will not be sent to the Administrative Contact for confirmation until any necessary changes have been made.</li>
</ul>
<p>LGRs may be revised according to the same process (i.e. request to
idn-tables@iana.org followed by confirmation request to Administrative Contact).
Updated LGRs must have a version number that is distinct from the current or
previously posted version of the LGR. Updates should be accompanied by a description
of the reason(s) for the request. </p>
<h2>Language and Script Codes</h2>
<p>When constructing Label Generation Rulesets (LGRs), the languages and scripts
the ruleset covers need to be specified. This is a list of common languages and
scripts to aid in the classification process. For less common classifications,
refer to the <a href="/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">IANA Language Subtag Registry</a>
and <a href="/go/rfc5646">RFC 5646</a>.</p>

<p>For special cases there may be a need to list entries without a specific language
or script classification. In such cases use <code>und</code>.</p>
<p>Note that we are unable to accept registrations for languages and script codes that are not recognized in the Language Subtag Registry.</p>
<h3>Common confusion with country codes</h3>
<p>As language names and country names are often similar, if not identical, there
is often confusion between the two. Be careful not to accidentally use
a country code when you intend to use a language code. Common errors we see
include "kr" instead of "ko" for Korean, "jp" instead of "ja" for Japanese,
and "dk" instead of "da" for Danish.</p>
<p>Country codes may be used, however, as geographic designators (which appear in
upper case in language tags). For example, "ja-JP" means "Japanese as used in
Japan," and "zh-TW" means "Chinese as used in Taiwan." Use script
tags ("Hant," "Hans," etc.) to denote distinctions between writing systems.</p>
